# LearningByDoing

This is a learning repository by Alexander D. and Kevin S.
We will try to publish usefull tips and tutorials on our every-day-wrokflow and try to improve our git skills along the way.

## How to write a good README

Github readmes are written in [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) syntax.
A quick tutorial for markdown in Github can be found [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), and a detailed one [here](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/).

## How to work with git

A good start is this [github workflow tutorial](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/), for further questions use the [git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2).
